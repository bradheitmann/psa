# PSA Screenshots

**Note:** These are temporary mockups. Generate real screenshots with:

```bash
cd ../demos
./generate-screenshots.sh
```

## Current Screenshots:

1. **dashboard-overview.png** - Main dashboard with metrics
2. **project-list.png** - Interactive project list (fzf)
3. **project-detail.png** - Detailed project view
4. **metrics-charts.png** - Token usage & LOC charts
5. **commands-demo.gif** - Animated command demo

## To Generate Real Screenshots:

Requires PSA to be running with sample data. The VHS tapes will:
- Launch PSA with example projects
- Navigate through features
- Capture colorful terminal output
- Export as PNG and GIF

Run:
```bash
./demos/generate-screenshots.sh
```

This replaces these mockups with actual terminal recordings.

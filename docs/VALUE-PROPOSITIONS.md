# PSA Value Propositions

Classic positioning statements for different target audiences.

---

## Primary Value Proposition (Main README)

**For developers who juggle multiple projects and lose track of what needs attention,** PSA provides a colorful terminal dashboard that surfaces critical metrics and progress indicators for all your codebases in one glance, **so you can instantly see which projects need work and jump straight to them** instead of manually checking each directory, running git status, and trying to remember what percentage complete everything is.

---

## Alternative Positioning Statements

### For Solo Developers

**For solo developers who maintain 5+ side projects simultaneously,** PSA creates a unified command center with visual progress tracking and one-keystroke navigation, **so you can context-switch between projects in seconds and know exactly where you left off** instead of spending 10 minutes every morning re-orienting yourself by running `cd`, `git status`, and `ls` across multiple directories.

---

### For Team Leads

**For engineering managers who oversee multiple microservices and repos,** PSA aggregates health metrics, git activity, and test coverage into a single real-time dashboard, **so you can identify blocked services and resource bottlenecks at a glance** instead of manually checking Slack threads, GitHub activity, and asking "what's the status?" in five different channels.

---

### For AI-Assisted Developers

**For developers using Claude Code who want to optimize their AI token budget,** PSA tracks tokens-per-line, session costs, and efficiency metrics across all projects with automatic calculation, **so you can identify which projects consume too many tokens and improve your prompting strategy** instead of blindly spending thousands of dollars without knowing where the inefficiency lies.

---

### For Freelancers

**For freelance developers managing multiple client projects with different deadlines,** PSA provides visual progress bars, custom billing metrics, and priority sorting, **so you can see which clients need deliverables this week and bill accurately for time spent** instead of maintaining manual spreadsheets, forgetting to track hours, and missing critical deadlines.

---

### For Open Source Maintainers

**For open source maintainers who manage multiple repos with varying activity levels,** PSA surfaces recent commit activity, contributor stats, and project health in one terminal command, **so you can quickly triage which repos need attention and which are stable** instead of opening GitHub 12 times and mentally tracking which project had that issue you needed to address.

---

### For Teams Using Evidence-Based Development

**For teams practicing rigorous quality gates and PM/Dev handoffs,** PSA provides structured evidence templates, automated gate verification, and standardized documentation workflows, **so you can prove every feature meets requirements with auditable artifacts** instead of ad-hoc documentation, forgotten test results, and "trust me, I tested it" handoffs.

## Breakdown of Each Component

### Target User: "For [X] who [Y]"

Examples:
- "developers who juggle multiple projects"
- "engineering managers who oversee microservices"
- "developers using Claude Code who want to optimize costs"
- "freelancers managing multiple client projects"

**Make it specific** - not just "developers" but "solo developers with 5+ projects"

---

### Problem/Desire: "who [stated need]"

Examples:
- "lose track of what needs attention"
- "want to optimize their AI token budget"
- "manage multiple repos with varying activity"

**Make it relatable** - real pain points people experience

---

### Solution: "PSA [does X] [uniquely Y]"

Examples:
- "provides a colorful terminal dashboard that surfaces critical metrics"
- "tracks tokens-per-line with automatic calculation"
- "aggregates health metrics into a single real-time dashboard"

**Make it tangible** - what exactly does PSA do differently

---

### Benefit: "so you can [outcome]"

Examples:
- "instantly see which projects need work"
- "identify which projects consume too many tokens"
- "context-switch between projects in seconds"

**Make it outcome-focused** - what becomes possible

---

### Fail State: "instead of [alternative]"

Examples:
- "manually checking each directory"
- "blindly spending thousands of dollars"
- "maintaining manual spreadsheets"

**Make it painful** - what they currently suffer through

---

## Usage by Context

### README.md Hero Section
Use **Primary** or **Solo Developer** version
- Broadest appeal
- Addresses common pain point
- Clear before/after

### Landing Page
Use **multiple versions** in tabs/sections
- "For Solo Devs" tab
- "For Teams" tab
- "For AI Users" tab

### Social Media
Use **shorter, punchier** versions:
- Twitter: "Stop losing track of 5+ projects. PSA shows everything in one colorful dashboard."
- LinkedIn: Professional version (Team Leads)

### Documentation
Use **context-specific** versions:
- Tutorial 1: Solo Developer
- Tutorial 2: Team Lead
- Tutorial 4: AI-Assisted Developer

---

## Recommended Primary (README.md)

**Choice: Solo Developer version** (most relatable)

Why:
- ✅ Speaks to largest audience (most devs have multiple projects)
- ✅ Clear pain point (context switching, mental overhead)
- ✅ Tangible benefit (seconds vs. minutes)
- ✅ Visual language ("colorful dashboard", "one-keystroke")
- ✅ Quantifiable (5+ projects, 10 minutes, seconds)

---

## Testing Value Props

### A/B Test Options

**Version A (Problem-focused):**
> Tired of losing track of multiple projects? PSA shows everything in one colorful terminal dashboard.

**Version B (Solution-focused):**
> PSA is a beautiful terminal dashboard that tracks all your coding projects with metrics, progress, and git activity.

**Version C (Outcome-focused):**
> See the health of all your projects in one glance. Jump to any codebase in seconds with PSA.

**Recommendation:** Test with real users, measure GitHub stars
